Here’s how I suggest we approach this:\n\n1. **Intelligence Gathering**: Collect information about the target (aub.edu.lb).\n2. **Scanning**: Identify open ports and services.\n3. **Exploitation**: Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in a controlled manner.\n4. **Post-Exploitation**: Assess the impact of successful exploits.\n5. **Reporting**: Compile findings and recommendations.\n\nIf this structure aligns with your expectations, I can facilitate the intelligence gathering phase.
